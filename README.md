## Services
1. **Vercel** (web server)

   Vercel serves as the web server that `users interact with`. It is responsible for handling user requests to upload and deploy projects.
   Vercel communicates with separate `gRPC` servers for handling these requests.

3. **Upload** (gRPC server)

   The Upload service is a `gRPC` server responsible for pulling the repository from GitHub and uploading it to `MinIO`, an `S3-compatible` object storage service. Once the upload is complete, the Upload service sends the status back to Vercel.

4. **Deploy** (gRPC server)

   The Deploy service is another `gRPC` server that pulls the repository code from S3, builds the project, and uploads the distribution to S3. Similar to the Upload service, it then sends the deployment status back to Vercel.

5. **Request Handler** (web server)

   The Request Handler service handles requests made to the `project endpoints generated by Vercel`.
